**Prediction: High-water marks with high elevations are usually "less flooded".**

The elevation of a given coordinate is a long-term factor, which won't change in years. And we predict that for a given location, the extent of "how flooded it is" is related to its elevation.

Surprisingly, no such negative correlation could be summarized from the scatterplot. And we learn from the map that more darker points are located far away from the coastline.
