**Prediction: High-water marks are more likely to appear in urban areas than rural areas.**

We randomly sample 1000 points (not shown in the map) within the hurricane-affected area, and extract the distance to their corresponding nearest high-water marks, and compare those with the population density of those points.

Ideally, if the prediction holds, there should be a clear tendency that, as distance to the nearest high-water mark increases, the population density decreases. However, no such relationship is observed.
